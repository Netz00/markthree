# Welcome to MarkThree ðŸŽ‰

MarkThree lets you read and write markdown from a single, seamless view. When you enter a text block, it toggles to editing mode, and when you exit, it instantly renders to HTML. It continuously, efficiently, and securely syncs your content with your Google Drive, so you can close your laptop, and pick up where you left off on your phone.

MarkThree stays snappy even for very large documents (tested on War & Peace), so you can use it for long-running efforts such as journals and running notes. You'll be able to navigate those big docs easily with quick, clear search results.

Plus it's free & open source!

// Bookmarks

Not a standard markdown feature, but very handy! Start a line with `// ` and it will show up by default in the Search view.

#### Images

Supports standard markdown syntax to link to images. You can also upload new images with the `/image` slash command.

#### Other HTML

The markdown spec is not intended to completely replace HTML, which you can fall back to if you want a particular tag or style. For example you can highlight text with the `mark` tag <mark>like this</mark>, or underline with the `u` tag <u>like this</u>.

<center><em>The center tag is also handy!</em></center>

#### Advanced text entry

- Automatic text expansion for `/now` and `/today`. Use `/date` to bring up a date picker.
- Want to make sure you can find something later? Try #hashtags and @mentions to stay organized.
- Use colons to search for :emojis: ðŸ˜Š

## And more!

- Offline mode âš¡ and dark mode ðŸŒ— available from `Settings` menu
- Import and export markdown via the `Docs` menu.
- Easily search your doc to match keywords and use quotes for "exact strings". Searching for #todo brings up all undone items from your checklists.
- MarkThree is a progressive web app (PWA)â€“that means you can save to your homescreen on mobile or desktop for an app-like experience with full screen and faster load times
